## a)

The log-likelihood function for a binary regression model: 
$$\ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i ln(\pi_i) + (1-y_i)ln(1-\pi_i)$$
How we arrived at this expression:
1. Start with the link function, aka logarithm of the odds, $ln(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}) = \sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i x_{i}$, where $x_0=1$. This can be written as $\pi = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i x_{i}}}$ 
2. Then we formulate the likelihood: $L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i | \beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\beta x_i))}\right)^{y_i} \left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\beta x_i))}\right)^{1-y_i}$ (here $\beta$ and $x_i$ are vectors, and $y_i$ is the response-variable). 
3. We get the log-likelihood by taking the logarithm: $\ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log\left(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\beta x_i))}\right) + (1 - y_i) \log\left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\beta x_i))}\right) \right]$
4. We put $\pi = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\beta x_i))}$ and get $\ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log\left(\pi_i\right) + (1 - y_i) \log\left(1 - \pi_i\right) \right]$.

```{r}
# importing data
filepath <- "https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4315/2018h/mountains"
mount <- read.table(file = filepath, header = TRUE, col.names = c("height",
    "prominence", "fail", "success"))
```

```{r}
# fitting model
logreg.mod = glm(cbind(success, fail) ~ height + prominence, data = mount, family = "binomial")
summary(logreg.mod)
# perform likelihood ratio test
logreg.null_mod = glm(cbind(success, fail) ~ 1, data = mount, family = "binomial")
anova(logreg.null_mod, logreg.mod, "LRT")
# creating 95% confint for beta

```
* We can see from the estimates that the log(odds) decrease when height or prominence increase, meaning the chance of success decreases. 
* The p-values obtained by performed wald-test suggest that the covariates are very signifacant. We also performed LRT, where the decrease in residual deviance from 715.29 in Model 1 to 414.68 in Model 2 indicates that Model 2 fits the data significantly better.
